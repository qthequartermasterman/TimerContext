class TimerContext:
    """Context manager to time a block of code using a `with` statement.

    Attributes:
        start: The start time.
        start_counter: A performance counter representing when the context
            began, in nanoseconds. This should only ever be compared against
            another performance counter.
        end: The end time (if the context manager has exited).
        end_counter: A performance counter representing when the context
            exited, in nanoseconds. This should only ever be compared against
            another performance counter.
        duration: The duration of the block of code. If the context manager has
            not exited, this will be the duration up to the current time.

    Note:
        Because of the additional overhead of the context manager, this may not
        be the most accurate way to time a block of fast code, in the order of
        single nanoseconds. For a slow block of code, the overhead should be
        proportionally small.

    Examples:
        >>> import time
        >>> with TimerContext() as operation_timer:
        ...     print(operation_timer.start)
        ...     print(operation_timer.duration)
        ...     print(time.sleep(2))
        ...     print(operation_timer.duration)
        ... print(operation_timer.end)
        ... print(operation_timer.duration)
        ... time.sleep(2)
        ... print(operation_timer.duration)
